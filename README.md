# CS497-B

Our project is to create a service to recommender systems for
movies and tv shows based on your personal tastes. Our project
combines our interests in scalable web systems, data science, 
and IR to help imitate modern systems. 

Here are some of our goals:
1. Develop a dashboard of user recommendations
- We'll need a variety of APIs to grab information on movies
such as their titles, posters, etc... It will display movies
and users can rate movies and leave reviews.
2. Movie Recommendation Engine in Flask
- We will initially need to train a dataset with any proposed model.
We'll be using the movielens dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
to train our movie data. We'll be utilizing a ML or Deep Learning model
that we haven't decided yet to recommend information based on user preferences.
3. Login/Authentication & User Management
- Provide a basic auth and user management system that a user can
update their information. It's important for users to have some of
these features for reasons related to customization and security.
