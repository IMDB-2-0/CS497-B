- I am a senior informatics student minoring in CS.
- I have experience in full stack development and data science. My main skills include:
    - Node/Express
    - SQL (Postgres and Microsoft SQL Server)
    - MongoDB
    - JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    - Python and R
    - Interactive visualizations: Shiny and D3
- I am interested in working with a team and with microservices. I’d like to be able to gain experience and insight where I can apply the knowledge I learn towards my career. Outside of that, I just thought microservices are cool and thought it would be fun to work with!

- I have experience in full stack development and DevOps. My main skills include:
    - Kubernetes & Docker 
    - Node/Express 
    - Python/Flask 
    - Postgres/Redis/MongoDB
- I am interested in working in a team and building a scalable web system together. I think gaining experience in working with microservices formally would really enhance my career outlook of being a DevopsEngineer. I think as an architecture, microservices are really important, and something I want to learn more about.
