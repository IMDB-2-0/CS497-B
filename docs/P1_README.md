## Team Organization
On Wednesdays at 12:30 we all will meet with Professor Richards and discuss our progress and trajectory. Besides these meetings we will work asynchronously, communicating through slack. This is ideal because excessive meetings can take up time and are hard to arrange among five students with varying schedules. Each team member will make significant commits to our GitHub repository on a  weekly basis to ensure our project is progressing in a timely way. Each one of us will contribute to each part of the program (front-end, back-end, DBMS, AIM, Devops) so as to maximize the skills learned for each of us. Timothy came up with the project idea so he will be guiding us at first about the overall design and direction of the project. However, we will all be involved in deciding the direction of the project as it progresses.

## Project Idea and Technologies
Our project idea is a movie recommendation system that will consist of a front-end, back-end, database, and containerization tools.

Databases: We are undecided between using Postgres or MongoDB. However, MongoDB will likely help maximize our project's scalability because it supports sharding and load-balancing.

Back-end: We are going to use flask for the backend because the movie recommender system will be Python-based. We may however use express and typescript as well for the backend.

Front-end: We may make a minimal webpage UI that presents movie recommendations and takes user ratings of movies as input. If so, we will likely use typescript, html, and a css framework. Typescript supports scalability and css frameworks help to make more seamless-looking websites.

Devops: We will likely use Docker in this project. Additionally, we may use Nginx and Kubernetes. These containerization tools make serving our website less resource-intensive and help us keep our site from crashing. Some of us have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and Nginx, while others have yet to understand their function in web development.
