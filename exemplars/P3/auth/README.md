# Auth - Timothy Nguyen

For this part of the project, I built an auth system with passport, JWT, and Google OAuth.

[**Google OAuth**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. To begin, we obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the Google API Console. Then your client application requests an access token from the Google Authorization Server, extracts a token from the response, and sends the token to the Google API that you want to access. 

We utilize the Google Login button to get users to login with google login. We supplement this code in the following manner: 

```

```

[**Passport**](http://www.passportjs.org/) is authentication middleware for Node.js. It's extremely flexible and modular. It can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
